# Note Gen (WIP)
- Powerpoint (pptx) to printable PDF

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then install dependencies:
pip install python-pptx reportlab

## Usage
Run the application:
ngUI.py

- LINE SPACING AND MARGINS are in POINTS (1 inch = 72pts)
- Only .ttf fonts work


## Use the GUI to:

Select your PowerPoint .pptx file

Choose font settings and customize appearance

Set output PDF path

Click Generate PDF

Your notes PDF will be ready for you!

### Definately not for forging notes section
You can use calligraphr to make your handwriting a font, just make sure you 

-download the .ttf

-install font


-copy from font folder to desktop(or other folder(because the program wont see it in your font folder))

And you can print it on notebook paper with 

-20.112 line spacing (for college ruled)

-100.8 top margin (for Pen+Gear College Ruled 1 Subject Poly notebook 9" x 11" at least) 

-0 bottom margin

### Future plans
I want to add AI note summerization as an option, and the UI needs some heavy polishing. 

any suggestions are much appreciated, im still learning how to code
